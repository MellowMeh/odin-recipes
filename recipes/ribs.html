    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe features cooking ribs in the oven, then grilling them over high heat for a smoky finish. Man, when your guests bite into these at the Memorial Day cookout, they'll savor meat so tender and juicy that it slides right off the bone and gets you the respect you deserve! I have found that the major restaurant chains who make this awesome dish pre-cook their ribs slowly before the quick grilling process.</p>
